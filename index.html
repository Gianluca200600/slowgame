              Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story arc played through 12-24
              sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts in a very
              similar fashion as basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the
              clock to travel around the world, treating disease hot spots while researching cures for each of four
              plagues before they get out of hand.
              During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in
              various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases
              (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been
              eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same
              color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to
              help them at these actions.
              After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which
              will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even
              further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to
              travel to.
              Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and
              immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for
              beneficial event cards.
              During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to
              permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing
              permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character
              can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.
